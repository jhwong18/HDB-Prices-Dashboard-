# HDB Prices Dashboard
In this repository, I have used SpotFire to create a dashboard to analyse the Prices for HDB Flats. This dashboard aims to provide users historical information on the HDB Flats in the following categories:

- Resale Flats
- Built-To-Order Flats
- Median Rent for Flats
- Resale Price Index


# Objective 
With this dashboard, users can compare the prices of HDB Flats in the regions that they would like to live and decide between whether to buy a resale flat, BTO flat or to rent a flat instead. This dashboard also provides information on the Resale Price Index. By dividing the Current Price of flat with the annual Rental Amount of the flat, users can compare this ratio against the Resale Price Index. If the calculated ratio is higher than the Resale Price Index, this shows that the flat is overvalued, vice versa. 


# Dataset
The datasets are obtained from https://data.gov.sg/
